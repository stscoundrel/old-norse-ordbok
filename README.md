### Install

`yarn add old-norse-ordbok`

### Usage

Orðbók scrapes the dictionary data using Puppeteer. The dictionary comes in two forms: either Old Norse -> English, or English -> Old Norse. The versions are not identical nor do they contain the same amount of words. This is a feature in the source material.

Old Norse -> English: 4589 words.
English -> Old Norse: 7712 words.

Words are returned in array of:

```javascript
{
    word: String,
    definition: String
}
```

Get dictionary data:

```javascript
const { oldNorseToEnglish, englishToOldNorse } = require('old-norse-ordbok')

const oldNorse = await oldNorseToEnglish()
const english = await englishToOldNorse()

console.log(oldNorse)
console.log(english)

```
